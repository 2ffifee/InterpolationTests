All valid test cases passed successfully, including basic interpolations with method chains and lambdas, edge cases like nested interpolation, and verbatim string comparisons. The compiler correctly blocked empty {} and whitespace-only { } interpolations with "expected expression" errors, which is expected behavior per the C# specification.

ReSharper provided suggestions during testing, recommending style improvements for nested interpolations and newline handling in string literals. These appeared as warnings, not errors, suggesting alternatives like simplifying nested interpolations or getting rid of unnecessary interpolation containing string with '\n' symbols. No actual bugs were found in the implementation.
